# Hyper V Manager  Virtualization Setup for Active Directory Lab

This screenshot shows the initial configuration stage of my Active Directory home lab using Hyper-V Manager on Windows. At this step, I am preparing the virtualized environment where my Domain Controller and additional Windows Server/Client machines will run. The Hyper-V console displays the host system (TCCHAM) with no virtual machines created yet.

The screenshot displays the New Virtual Machine Wizard within Hyper-V Manager, where I began provisioning a virtual machine that will host the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role. This step initializes the VM creation process prior to installing Windows Server and configuring the domain environment
